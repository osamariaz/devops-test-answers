## Exercices

  1. I have added different stages in DockerFile to tackle multi-stage enviornment like dev , uat and production all of which will be using base node image. I Have tried to keep it as simple as possible for this project as we can have plenty of other options in DockerFile like Env , Conf according to the enviornment we are using.
  3. Design the cloud infrastructure diagram (prefer AWS) with all the resources that are required for the application(Node app, `statsd` & the backend. Applicants can use any backends for `statsd` eg: `Graphite`). Use ECS or EKS as application platform.
  4. Utilize Terraform to establish infrastructure that adheres to industry-standard security and high availability (HA) practices.
  5. (Optional) Deploy on the cloud computing platforms
