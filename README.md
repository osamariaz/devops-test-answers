  1. Add a `Dockerfile` to containerize the app, with support for multiple environments (DEV, UAT & Production)
     a) I have added different stages in DockerFile to tackle multi-stage enviorement like dev , uat and production all of which will be using base node image.
  3. Design the cloud infrastructure diagram (prefer AWS) with all the resources that are required for the application(Node app, `statsd` & the backend. Applicants can use any backends for `statsd` eg: `Graphite`). Use ECS or EKS as application platform.
  4. Utilize Terraform to establish infrastructure that adheres to industry-standard security and high availability (HA) practices.
  5. (Optional) Deploy on the cloud computing platforms
