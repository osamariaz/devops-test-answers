## Exercices

  1. I have added different stages in DockerFile to tackle multi-stage enviornment like dev , uat and production all of which will be using base node image. I Have tried to keep it as simple as possible for this project as we can have plenty of other options in DockerFile like Env , Conf according to the enviornment we are using.
  2. Architecture Diagram AWS.
  3. Terraform to deploy on aws but on public subnet because of free tier limit else it was supposed to be deployed in private subnet allowing only graphite web accessible on internet.
  4. Let me know when you need to see it running i can execute it from my end as it's free tier i'm saving my resources.
